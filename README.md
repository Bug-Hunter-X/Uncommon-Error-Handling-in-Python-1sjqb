This repository contains a Python example demonstrating an uncommon error handling scenario. The `bug.py` file shows a function with a nested `try-except` block designed to handle `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` exceptions gracefully, returning informative error messages. The `bugSolution.py` file is identical to show the solution, the focus is on the nuanced error handling. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling, especially when dealing with various input types and potential exceptions.
